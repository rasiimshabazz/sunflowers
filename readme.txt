A Collatz sequence in mathematics can be defined as follows.

Starting with any positive integer:

if n is even, the next number in the sequence is the result of the step: n / 2
if n is odd, the next number in the sequence is the result of the step:  3n + 1

It's conjectured that every such sequence of steps should eventually reach the number 1.

1. Write a program that proves that conjecture.

2. What input n <= 1000000 gives the longest step?
